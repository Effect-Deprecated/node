### Node Runtime and Utilities

Runtime, Streams and a set of interops with the node environment

## Install

We recommend the usage of `yarn` and if you he packages the usage of `yarn workspaces` that handles by default hoisting of dependencies:

```sh
yarn add @effect-ts/system @effect-ts/tracing-utils @effect-ts/core @effect-ts/node
```
